## ğŸ’» Hi, I'm a Flutter Developer from Poland and I'm 16 years old.

My tasks and skills as Flutter Developer:

ğŸš€ UI Development

ğŸš€ Database integration (Firebase Cloud Firestore, Firebase Storage)

ğŸš€ Firebase functions integration (Authentication, Crashlytics, Performance, Analytics)

ğŸš€ APIs implementation

ğŸš€ GetX (state management)

ğŸš€ Bloc (state management (basics))


I'm developing mobile apps ğŸ“± since Feb 2020 (Xamarin.Forms then - now Flutter). 
In early 2021 I switched to Flutter which fits me better and since then I'm creating mobile apps only with Flutter (~one year of experience)

ğŸ›  My open-source projects you can find at: https://github.com/MonsieurZbanowanYY or in the "Projects" section inside "Accomplishments" (LinkedIn).
