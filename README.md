## ðŸ’» Hi, I'm a Flutter Developer from Poland and I'm 16 years old.

My tasks and skills as Flutter Developer:

ðŸš€ UI Development

ðŸš€ Database integration (Firebase Cloud Firestore, Firebase Storage)

ðŸš€ Firebase functions integration (Authentication, Crashlytics, Performance, Analytics)

ðŸš€ APIs implementation

ðŸš€ Bloc (state management)

ðŸš€ GetX (state management)



I'm developing mobile apps ðŸ“± since Feb 2020 (Xamarin.Forms in the past -> now Flutter). 

In early 2021 I switched to Flutter which fits me better and since then I'm creating mobile apps only with Flutter (~two years of experience)
